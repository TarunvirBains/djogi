//! Internal expression AST node — the untyped dynamic payload behind the
//! typed [`Expr<T>`](super::Expr) wrapper.
//!
//! # What
//!
//! [`ExprNode`] is an untyped enum tree: leaves are `Field { column }` /
//! `Literal(FilterValue)`, internal nodes are arithmetic, comparison, and
//! (in later phases) subquery / aggregate / CASE forms. The typed
//! [`Expr<T>`](super::Expr) wrapper projects `T`-safety over this dynamic
//! core so user-facing APIs stay typed while the SQL emitter only has one
//! variant tree to walk.
//!
//! # Why separate the typed wrapper from the node?
//!
//! - **One emitter walk.** [`super::sql::emit_expr`] matches this enum
//!   exhaustively. If `ExprNode` were polymorphic in `T`, every emitter
//!   call site would monomorphise per-type; by erasing `T` at the enum
//!   boundary we get one codegen path and one set of tests.
//! - **Arithmetic composition.** `Expr<i32> + Expr<i32>` yields `Expr<i32>`
//!   — the typed wrapper enforces the operator is only available for
//!   numeric `T`, but the node it wraps stores a plain `Add(Box<_>, Box<_>)`
//!   regardless of `T`. Same pattern for comparisons (`Expr<T>.eq(Expr<T>)
//!   -> Expr<bool>` — the wrapper changes `T` from `T` to `bool`, the node
//!   is a `Cmp { op: Eq, .. }`).
//! - **Phase expansion.** Tasks 4 / 5 add `Case`, `Exists`, `Subquery`,
//!   `Aggregate`, and `OuterRef` variants. Keeping the enum untyped means
//!   those additions don't ripple into every type-parameterised site; only
//!   the emitter and a few typed constructors grow.
//!
//! # Where
//!
//! - [`super::Expr`] — typed wrapper, the public surface.
//! - [`super::sql::emit_expr`] — the matching emitter (one arm per variant).
//! - [`crate::query::condition::Condition::Expr`] — the bridge that promotes
//!   an `Expr<bool>` into the filter tree.

// TODO(Phase 4 Task 4/5): extend this enum with the variants sketched in the
// plan's Contract Decision #3 — `Case { arms, otherwise }`, `Exists(..)`,
// `Subquery(..)`, `Aggregate { op, arg, filter }`, `OuterRef { column }`.
// The emitter in `expr::sql` will need matching arms in lockstep. The
// `#[non_exhaustive]` marker is crate-private today (same-crate matches are
// already exhaustive); it becomes relevant if/when this enum is re-exported.
